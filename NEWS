nat.nblast 1.1
==============
* fix: make smat.fcwb the default scoring matrix (rather than smat_alpha) when
  nblast's UseAlpha paramater is FALSE (the default) and smat_alpha.fcwb the
  default when UseAlpha=TRUE.
* rename smat->smat.fcwb and smat_alpha->smat_alpha.fcwb to make it clear that
  these are defined in the FCWB template space (though they should work OK for
  other fly template brains that have an absolute physical scale)
* don't set options("nat.nblast.defaultsmat""), just query it.
* doc: basic package documentations
