nat.nblast 1.5
==============
* switch from importing nat to depending on it

nat.nblast 1.4
==============
* use nabor package, not RANN, for finding nearest neighbours
* add functions for creating sparse score matrices, using spam package
* speed up extraction of diagonal elements for on-disk score matrices
* nblast now handles all combinations of neuron and dotprops objects

nat.nblast 1.3
==============
* functions to create scoring matrices; see create_scoringmatrix for details.
* fix: really use nhclust's distfun argument
* new nblast_allbyall function
* add plyr support (gives parallelisation and progress bar options)

nat.nblast 1.2
==============
* add nhclust, plot3d.hclust, subset.hclust to help cluster/plot based on
  nblast scores (all ported from flycircuit package).
* rename showSimilarity -> show_similarity
* dev: make sure tests run during check()
* test: update baselines given score matrix changes in 1.1

nat.nblast 1.1
==============
* fix: make smat.fcwb the default scoring matrix (rather than smat_alpha) when
  nblast's UseAlpha paramater is FALSE (the default) and smat_alpha.fcwb the
  default when UseAlpha=TRUE.
* rename smat->smat.fcwb and smat_alpha->smat_alpha.fcwb to make it clear that
  these are defined in the FCWB template space (though they should work OK for
  other fly template brains that have an absolute physical scale)
* don't set options("nat.nblast.defaultsmat""), just query it.
* doc: basic package documentations
